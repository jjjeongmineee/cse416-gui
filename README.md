## GOALS

For this GUI, we will be using Figma as a goal to make a dynamic front-end for our information display.

### Goal 1
Build a dynamic website to display information on the run.

### Goal 2
Incorporate a dynamic map view where the user can click on a congressional district to zoom into that specific district.

### Goal 3
Following the completion of GOAL 2, clicking on a county will zoom into the precincts in that county.

### Goal 4
Clicking on a precinct leads into a different page with data about that precinct.
