# CSE 416 Team Muze GUI  

### Run this program using `npm start`



For this GUI, we will be using Figma as a goal to make a dynamic front-end for our information display.

## GOAL 1
Build a dynamic website to display information on the run.

## GOAL 2
Incorporate a dynamic map view where the user can click on a congressional district to zoom into that specific district.

## GOAL 3
Following the completion of GOAL 2, clicking on a county will zoom into the precincts in that county.

## GOAL 4
Clicking on a precinct leads into a different page with data about that precinct.
