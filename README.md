## Figma
See the figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mtzYQA6ditkqzaFOftHSSa/Home-Page-Design?node-id=0%3A1).

## GOALS

For this GUI, we will be using Figma as a goal to make a dynamic front-end for our information display.

### Goal 1
Build a dynamic website to display information on the run.

### Goal 2
Incorporate a dynamic map view where the user can click on a congressional district to zoom into that specific district.

### Goal 3
Following the completion of GOAL 2, clicking on a county will zoom into the precincts in that county.

### Goal 4
Clicking on a precinct leads into a different page with data about that precinct.

### Goal 5
Clicking on each states will lead to page showing data relevant to redistricting.

# Java/Server Side

### Initially run `javac` on all the objects to create .class files.
### Then run `java` on the main where all files are executed to run the program.
